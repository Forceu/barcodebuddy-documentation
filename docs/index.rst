Barcode Buddy for Grocy
=======================================================

Barcode Buddy for Grocy is an extension for `Grocy`_, allowing to pass barcodes to Grocy. It supports barcodes for products and chores. If you own a physical barcode scanner, it can be integrated, so that all barcodes scanned are automatically pushed to BarcodeBuddy/Grocy.
